# Using SignalWire AI Agent, build IVR that uses Google Web Search
At [Cluecon 2025 conference](https://www.cluecon.com/schedule-2025), the SignalWire team was introducing their new [Agents SDK](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/agents-sdk/). This is a Python environment for an AI-based IVR. On a poster at the conference was an example use case of a web search bot.  The poster had some code on it; I implemented it and saved the code in this repository.

On the registration table the same Python script was distributed to the conference on little index cards.

## Summary
I wrote the code and uploaded it to a repository to document my work.  I did the following setup to get this code running.

- Clone Repository
- Get GOOGLE API Key and Search Engine ID
- Setup .env with key, ID and SignalWire Auth data
- Building and run dev-agent.py using docker compose build, then up -d
- verify log files ok
- setup firewall to route port 3000 to reverse proxy
- setup reverse proxy to map https://*.swaig.kozik.net -> http://192.168.100.128:3000
- Verify webhook URL  http://jkozik:XXXXXX:3000
- Verify webhook URL https://jkozik:XXXXXXXX@swaig.kozik.net
- Provision webhook URL above into a SignalWire Phone number's `When a call comes in`
- Call the phone number and verify interaction

Note: I have a well tested reverse proxy that leverages Let's Encrypt for https URLs.  Adding an additional mapping for this service is easy.  To me, much easier than ngrok. 

## dev-agent.py
On my home server, I setup a project and created the file dev-agent.py
```
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat dev-agent.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

#load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
load_dotenv()

# Create an agent
agent = AgentBase(name="franklin")

# Add some basic capabilities
agent.prompt_add_section("role", "you are Franklin, the web search bot.")
agent.prompt_add_section("instructions",
                         bullets=["Ask the user what they want to search for on the web"])

agent.add_language("English", "en-US", "rime.spore")

print("os.getenv test")
print( f"{os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY')=}")
agent.add_skill("web_search", {
    "api_key": os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY'),
    "search_engine_id": os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID')
})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()

(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$
```
Note a few things:
- I put the SWML authenication, GOOGLE API key and id in a .env file.  See end of README for more details.
- As part of my getting started setup, I created a virtual environment (venv).  Setup not shown

## My setup
To run this script, I put it on my home server in a Docker container.  I have a reverse proxy that manages a LetEncrypt based reverse proxy, letting me dedicate a subdomain for linkage between the script and SignalWire.  

Here's a picture of my setup.

<img width="1289" height="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e909739-2de3-4ace-aed2-9e2544ed46b8" />

## Docker setup
As a personal preferene, I like putting scripts like this, that is ones that run as an API with a REST interface on a dedicated port, I like putting them into docker containers.  It makes it easier for me to share with others and re-create if I ever want to run them again.
My docker file is really simple:
```
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000

(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                                                                              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
swaia-google-dev-agent                                                                                  latest    1587f1f0049e   24 hours ago    235MB
```
My docker-compose.yml file has some important things:
```
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  dev-agent:
    build: .
    container_name: swaia-google-agent
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY}
      - GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=${GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID}
      - SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=${SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER}
      - SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=${SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./.env:/app/.env:ro
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    restart: unless-stopped(
```
I have GOOGLE and SignalWire Markup environment variables.  I have a .env file with the secrets.  The script will not work without these.

## docker-compose.yml
The build is very straight forward:

Note a couple things:
- I XXX'd out the secrets.  The AgentBase class shares the keys in the logfile.  If you don't supply them, they will get generated.
- You'll need to consult the logfile to complete the SignalWire integration

## Verify dev-agent.py 
First, verify that port 3000 can be accessed from the home LAN.

Note a few things:
- the URL includes a user, a password and points to port 3000
- Piping the output through jq, one can see that this agent is web hook and is feeding prompt information to SignalWire.

Also, verify from an external network.  This should return the same thing, but over https through my reverse proxy.

This worked, but I didn't pretty print it. 

## Provision the URL into SignalWire
The URL used in the above test needs to be provisioned into the SignalWire `Phone Number` -> `Handle Calls Using` as `a SWML Script`.  The URL needs to be inserted into the `When a call comes in` field.

Save the changes and call the phone number.  It is interesting to look at the docker log file.  You'll see a web hook call per interaction with the service.  

## Summary

I found this easy to setup.  SignalWire is doing the integration between the LLM and the IVR system. From this basic Python script one can expand to a whole series of IVR services, assisted by an LLM using data from a wide range of API-based tools.  

The default setup generated a new Authentication Password.  Leading to the need to update the SignalWire provisioning after every code change.  My .env setup makes tinkering much easier to do. 


# Setting up Google API Keys
To setup the Google keys for Custom Search API access, you need to get a google cloud API Key and a Search Engine Key.  

To start, at the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=vaulted-night-270914).

It will prompt to setup a project, I picked "My First Project" -- the default name.  Then I went to the Credentials on the lefthand side. On the top, click on `+ Create Credentials` and select `API Key`.

I created the key, called `API Key` with no restrictions. Set the API key into the .env file as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY`

To get a Search Engine ID, go to the [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all) control panel and `Add`

I called it `google`.  When created you'll see Search Engine ID.  Set the ID into the .env file as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`

## SWML Basic Authentication
To work with SignalWire Agent SDK, user and a password need to be setup.  By default, the AgentBase class library will generate a default user name of `signalwire` and a > 20 character random password.  Each time, the class initializes, a new password is generated.  This is a pain, because that password needs to be inserted into the URL from SignalWire's   `When a Call Comes in` script parameter.

Therefore, I use the environement variables SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER and SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in .env.

If the SignalWire provision disagrees with these environment variables, a call to the SignalWire phone number returns "Sorry that number cannot be reached."
