# Using SignalWire AI Agent, build IVR that uses Google Web Search
At [Cluecon 2025 conference](https://www.cluecon.com/schedule-2025), the SignalWire team was introducing their new [AI Agents SDK](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/agents-sdk/). This is a Python environment for an AI-based IVR. On a poster at the conference there was an example use case of a web search bot.  I implemented it, and saved the code in this repository.

On the registration table the same Python script was distributed to the conference on little index cards.

In the [SignalWire AI Agent SDK QuickStart](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/agents-sdk/quickstart/#create-your-first-agent) they named this short program `dev-agent.py`.  Thus I will use the same name in this repository. 

## Summary
For my reference and perhaps the benefit of others, I recorded the steps I followed to get this work.  Here's a summary.  The following sections give lots of details.  

- Clone Repository
- Get GOOGLE API Key and Search Engine ID
- Setup .env with key, ID and SignalWire Auth data
- On server my server 192.168.100.128, build and run `dev-agent.py` using `docker compose build` then `docker compose up -d`
- verify log files ok
- setup firewall to route port 3000 to my private reverse proxy
- setup reverse proxy to map URL https://*.swaig.kozik.net -> http://192.168.100.128:3000
- Verify URL  http://jkozik:XXXXXX:3000
- Verify  URL https://jkozik:XXXXXXXX@swaig.kozik.net  (tests reverse proxy, Let's Encrypt)
- Provision URL above into a SignalWire Phone number's `When a call comes in`
- Call the phone number and verify interaction

Note: I have a reverse proxy on my home LAN that leverages Let's Encrypt for https URLs.  Adding an additional mapping for this service is easy.  To me, much easier than `ngrok`. 

# My setup -- A picture plus the steps I followed
To run this script, I put it on my home server in a Docker container.  My home network has a reverse proxy that manages incoming https:// URLs, mapping specific URLs to internal servers/ports. This lets me dedicate the subdomain https://swaig.xxxxxx.net for linkage between the script and SignalWire.  

Here's a picture of my setup.

## dev-agent.py
On my home server, I setup a project and created the file dev-agent.py
```python
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat dev-agent.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

#load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
load_dotenv()

# Create an agent
agent = AgentBase(name="franklin")

# Add some basic capabilities
agent.prompt_add_section("role", "you are Franklin, the web search bot.")
agent.prompt_add_section("instructions",
                         bullets=["Ask the user what they want to search for on the web"])

agent.add_language("English", "en-US", "rime.spore")

print("os.getenv test")
print( f"{os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY')=}")
agent.add_skill("web_search", {
    "api_key": os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY'),
    "search_engine_id": os.getenv('GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID')
})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()

(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$
```
Note a few things:
- The default dev-agent.py generated a new Authentication Password, leading to the need to update the SignalWire provisioning after every code change.  My .env setup makes tinkering much easier to do. I put the SWML authenication, GOOGLE API key and id in a .env file.  See end of README for more details.
- I setup a venv and ran this program from the command line.  It is good for initial setup, I prefer things in Docker containers


## Docker setup
In Docker containers, I find that it makes it easier for me to share with others and re-create if I ever want to run them again.
My `Dockerfile` file is straight forward.
```dockerfile
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
```
```shell
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                                                                              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
swaia-google-dev-agent                                                                                  latest    1587f1f0049e   24 hours ago    235MB
```
An image size of 235MB is not bad.

My `docker-compose.yml` file has some important things:
```
(.venv) jkozik@u2004:~/projects/swaia-google$ cat docker-compose.yml
```
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  dev-agent:
    build: .
    container_name: swaia-google-agent
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY}
      - GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=${GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID}
      - SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=${SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER}
      - SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=${SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./.env:/app/.env:ro
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    restart: unless-stopped(
```
I have GOOGLE and SignalWire Markup environment variables held in a .env file.  The script will not work without these correctly provisioned.  See sections below for instructions for setting these variables. 

## docker-compose.yml
The build is very straight forward:

Note a couple things:
- I XXX'd out the secrets.  The AgentBase class shares the keys in the logfile.  If you don't supply them, they will get generated and logged here.
- From the logfile, one can see that agent_base runs on port 3000 of a FastAPI-based web service.  

## Verify dev-agent.py 
From a terminal on the Home LAN, run the command below to verify that port 3000 can be accessed.

```
Note a few things:
- the URL includes a user id, a password and points to port 3000
- Piping the output through jq, one can see that this agent is web hook and is feeding prompt information to SignalWire.

From a terminal window running on a host outside of the home LAN, verify that the https:// version of the URL works.  This verifies both the Let's Encrypt TLS processing and the reverse proxy URL to port mapping.

This worked, but I didn't pretty print it. Note: no need to reference port 3000; the reverse proxy maps from port 443 to 3000

## Provision the URL into SignalWire
The URL used in the above test needs to be provisioned into the SignalWire.  From the SignalWire dashboard, in my case that's https://jkozik.signalwire.com/dashboard  (password protected) select on the left hand column:  `Phone Number` -> `Handle Calls Using` as `a SWML Script`.  The URL needs to be inserted into the `When a call comes in` field. I used an existing phone number.  You may need to buy your own if you don't already have one.

Save the changes and call the phone number.  It is interesting to look at the docker log file.  You'll see a web hook call per interaction with the service.  

## Summary

The dev-agent.py python program is a really good "Hello World" example script to help me learn the SignalWire AI Agent SDK.  For me, the next step is to study some of the [Agent API Examples](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-agents/blob/main/examples/README.md)




# Setting up Google API Keys
To setup the Google keys for Custom Search API access, you need to get a google cloud API Key and a Search Engine Key.  

To start, at the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=vaulted-night-270914).  

<img width="1655" height="827" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db002906-82e5-4de0-8603-c7cdc779c648" />

It will prompt to setup a project, I picked "My First Project" -- the default name.  Then I went to the Credentials on the lefthand side. On the top, click on `+ Create Credentials` and select `API Key`.  

<img width="1536" height="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2e6b7c4-dd24-4c7a-bea1-3feb6287447c" />

I created the key, called `API Key` with no restrictions. Set the API key into the .env file as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY`

To get a Search Engine ID, go to the [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all) control panel and `Add` 

<img width="1475" height="921" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/374349b7-3eeb-4046-8e9c-44ff5bb4a3d1" />

I called it `google`.  When created you'll see Search Engine ID.  Set the ID into the .env file as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`

<img width="857" height="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6831bbf-2d34-451b-ba98-28647c086b85" />

## SWML Basic Authentication
To work with SignalWire AI Agent SDK, user and a password need to be setup.  By default, the AgentBase class library will generate a default user name of `signalwire` and a > 20 character random password.  Each time, the class initializes, a new password is generated.  This is a pain, because that password needs to be inserted into the URL from SignalWire's   `When a Call Comes in` script parameter.

Therefore, I use the environement variables `SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` in .env.

If the SignalWire provisioning disagrees with these environment variables, a call to the SignalWire phone number returns "Sorry that number cannot be reached."
